Here are some steps to configure an FTP server for improved security:

1.  Use strong authentication: Require strong passwords and consider using public key authentication instead of passwords.

2.  Limit access: Only allow FTP access to users who need it, and limit the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the FTP server.

3.  Use encryption: Use encryption protocols such as SSL or TLS to encrypt communications between the FTP server and clients.

4.  Use a non-standard port: Change the default FTP port to a non-standard port to reduce the likelihood of automated attacks.

5.  Monitor logs: Regularly monitor server logs for unusual activity and suspicious activity, and consider using a log analysis tool to help identify security-related events.

6.  Disable unneeded features: Disable any features in the FTP server that are not needed for the server's purpose.

7.  Regularly update software: Regularly update the FTP server software to address any security vulnerabilities.

8.  Use firewalls: Use firewalls to limit incoming and outgoing traffic to the FTP server, and to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.

These steps can provide a strong foundation for securing your FTP server, but the specific security measures you choose will depend on the server's purpose and the level of security you require.
