Here are some steps to configure a SQL server for improved security:

1.  Use strong authentication: Require strong passwords and consider using two-factor authentication for users who need to access the SQL server.

2.  Limit access: Only allow access to the SQL server from authorized IP addresses, and limit the number of users who are allowed to access the server.

3.  Use encryption: Use encryption protocols such as SSL or TLS to encrypt communications between the SQL server and clients.

4.  Use role-based access controls: Use role-based access controls to limit the actions that users are allowed to perform on the SQL server.

5.  Monitor logs: Regularly monitor server logs for unusual activity and suspicious activity, and consider using a log analysis tool to help identify security-related events.

6.  Regularly update software: Regularly update the SQL server software and any related tools to address any security vulnerabilities.

7.  Use firewalls: Use firewalls to limit incoming and outgoing traffic to the SQL server, and to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.

8.  Disable unneeded features: Disable any features in the SQL server that are not needed for the server's purpose.

These steps can provide a strong foundation for securing your SQL server, but the specific security measures you choose will depend on the server's purpose and the level of security you require.
