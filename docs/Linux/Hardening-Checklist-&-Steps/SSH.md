Here are some steps to configure an SSH server for improved security:

1.  Use strong authentication: Require strong passwords and consider using public key authentication instead of passwords.

2.  Disable root login: Do not allow root login over SSH. Instead, use a regular user account and elevate privileges as needed using the "sudo" command.

3.  Limit access: Only allow SSH access to users who need it, and limit the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the SSH server.

4.  Use encryption: Use encryption protocols such as SSL or TLS to encrypt communications between the SSH server and clients.

5.  Use a non-standard port: Change the default SSH port to a non-standard port to reduce the likelihood of automated attacks.

6.  Disable unneeded features: Disable any features in the SSH server that are not needed for the server's purpose. For example, if the server does not require SFTP access, disable the SFTP service.

7.  Monitor logs: Regularly monitor server logs for unusual activity and suspicious activity, and consider using a log analysis tool to help identify security-related events.

8.  Regularly update software: Regularly update the SSH server software to address any security vulnerabilities.

These steps can provide a strong foundation for securing your SSH server, but the specific security measures you choose will depend on the server's purpose and the level of security you require.
